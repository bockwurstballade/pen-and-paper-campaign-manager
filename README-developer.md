This Readme is completely optional for developers that are interested in extending the functionality of this code. See this as a personal recommendation from my end on how to setup your environment if you want to extend this piece of software.

Download Python 3.10 and install it on Windows

### Update pip

I recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as development environment.
